# Notes

## Main question
Does longer code line-length make your code worse?

Aside from a readability standpoint and all the arguments that come with e.g. editor's layout (split view vs single editor), wide screen etc..., is there a significant impact on code complexity?


## Structure

Two-part blog series:

1. Findings and analysis
2. The engineering side

### 1. Software engineering
Since I am actually doing that first, I need to:

* List Github repositories that meet search criteria
* Fetch attributes for the repo, e.g. language split, watchers, stars, forks, contributors, commits, state (archived or not)
* Complexity for the files and average line length by project
